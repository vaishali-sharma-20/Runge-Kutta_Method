# Runge-Kutta_Method
Here, Code of  Picard Iterative Method of Computer Oriented Numerical Methods in Java Language. In numerical analysis, the Rungeâ€“Kutta methods are a family of implicit and explicit iterative methods, which include the Euler method, used in temporal discretization for the approximate solutions of simultaneous nonlinear equations
